Located on the first floor of a limestone \"Bordeaux style\" building, the flat is at only few meters away from one of the most beautiful square of Bordeaux (Place Camille Jullian - known for its terraces and its stunning cinema) and next to the longest pedestrian shopping street of France (rue Sainte Catherine).   BEDROOM:  -wooden floor  -very comfy new bedding (size 160X 200).

BATHROOM  Light and clean bathroom with a bath.  (The toilets are separated from the bathroom).   WIFI/INTERNET ACCESS   How to come to my flat?   FROM THE SATION:  - take the TRAM C (towards les Aubiers/City center) and get off at Place de La Bourse (the journey takes 10 minutes). Then there is 6 minutes walk to get to the flat (via rue du Pas Saint Georges).   FROM THE AIRPORT:  - take the bus LIANE 1 and get off at the last stop \"Les Quinconces\" (the journey takes 45 minutes - 1,40€). Then there is a 10 minutes walk (via rue Sainte Catherine to reach the flat).   IF YOU HAVE A CAR:  Just opposite the doorstep there is an access to the PARKING Camille Jullian (24 € for 24 hours of parking).   This area is surrounded by tram stations (all at 8 minutes by foot maximum): Place de la Bourse, Sainte Catherine, Grand Theatre, Hôtel de Ville.
